   <b>Kapil Dev Ramlal Nikhanj</b> (Pronunciation: [kəpiːl deːʋ]; born 6 January 1959) is an Indian former cricketer. He was a fast-medium bowler and a hard-hitting middle-order batsman, and was named by Wisden as the Indian Cricketer of the Century in 2002.

Dev captained the Indian cricket team that won the 1983 Cricket World Cup,[4] and in the process became the first Indian captain to win the Cricket World Cup, and is still the youngest captain (at the age of 24) to win the World Cup for any team.[5] He retired in 1994, at the time holding the world record for the highest number of wickets taken in Test cricket, a record subsequently broken by Courtney Walsh in 2000.[6] At the time, he was also India's highest wicket-taker in both major forms of cricket, Tests and ODIs. He is the first player to take 200 ODI wickets.[7] He is the only player in the history of cricket to have taken more than 400 wickets (434 wickets) and scored more than 5,000 runs in Tests,[8] making him one of the greatest all-rounders in the history of cricket.[9] Dev's all-round performance has been praised by cricketers including Sunil Gavaskar who regards him as one of the greatest all-rounders to play the game.[10] He was the coach of the Indian national team between September 1999 and September 2000.[11] On 11 March 2010, Dev was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.[12] In 1982 awarded with the Padma Shri and in 1991 the Padma Bhushan.

   <b> Captain: 1983 World Cup Champions (1982–1984)</b>
Dev debuted as India's captain in the 1982–83 season against Sri Lanka (before the Pakistan tour) when Gavaskar was rested. His first assignment as regular captain was the tour of West Indies, where the biggest accomplishment was a lone ODI victory. Dev (72) and Gavaskar (90) led India to a huge score – 282/5 in 47 overs and Dev's 2 wickets aided India to restrict West Indies for 255 and a victory[35] that Indian cricketers claim gave them the confidence to face the West Indies team in 1983 Cricket World Cup.[36] Overall, Dev had a good series in West Indies as he scored a century to save the second test match[37] as well as picking up 17 wickets (Average: 24.94)
